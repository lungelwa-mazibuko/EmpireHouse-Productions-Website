# 🎬 EmpireHouse Booking & Rental System

**Team Name:** Web Wizards  
**Team Members:** Asemahle Nonkwelo & Makaphile Jula  
**Client:** Empire House Productions  
**Duration:** August – November 2025  
**Process Model:** Agile (3 Sprints managed in Azure DevOps)

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose
EmpireHouse Productions relied on a manual booking process for studios and equipment, resulting in scheduling conflicts, late payments, and limited visibility into daily operations.  
This project aims to replace that system with a **modern web and mobile solution** that automates studio bookings, equipment rentals, payments, and invoice management.

---

## ⚙️ System Overview
The EmpireHouse digital system consists of:
- **Web Admin Dashboard:** Manage studios, bookings, payments, and reports.  
- **Mobile App (Kotlin + Firebase):** Allows clients to book studios and rent equipment.  
- **Secure Payment Integration (PayFast Sandbox):** Processes online payments and auto-generates invoices.  
- **Firebase Firestore Database:** Real-time updates for bookings, users, and invoices.  
- **Azure DevOps Integration:** Used for boards, sprints, repos, pipelines, and testing.
